1)  LEE
{normalC}{body-a}These generators are enough to power the whole dairy?
2)  LEE
{normalD}{body-c}Is it just the three of you here?
3)  ANDY
{normalA}{body-handships}'Fraid so. {sadA}We lost Daddy the first month.
4)  ANDY
{angryA}{body-a}Then we had some run-ins with the fuckin' bandits about a month and a half ago, {sadA}killed one of the hands.
5)  ANDY
{angryA}{body-a}Then HE came back and took out the rest of the hands before we could stop him.
6)  LEE
{thinkingB}{body-c}An electric fence is enough to keep out walkers?
7)  ANDY
{happyC}{body-a}Walkers? {happyB}Is that what you call them? That's good. [beat] {normalC}{body-handships}The old one wouldn't have, but Mac -- {body-a}he was our foreman -- {happyA}he figured out how to amp it up with the generators.
8)  ANDY
{happyB}We used to sit out here some nights and watch the sons o' bitches sizzle and pop when they got too close.
9)  ANDY
{happyA}Closest thing to entertainment these days, I guess.
10)  ANDY
[pickup1][stern.  Seriously not letting Lee in the house with a weapon]Lee, I'm serious.  Leave your axe out here.
11)  LEE
[pickup1]We're not leaving our weapons out here.
12)  ANDY
[pickup1][kindly insisting they leave their weapons outside]Look, I'm not trying to be a prick, but that's Momma's rule.  You wanna eat, you do what she says.
13)  LARRY
[pickup1][annoyed that Lee is beings stubborn about laying down his weapon]Get a move on, Lee. I'm starving!
14)  LEE
[pickup1][not sure that leaving their weapons outside is a good idea]I'd feel better if we could keep our weapons with us.
15)  ANDY
[pickup1]If it were up to me, that'd be fine.  But it's Momma's rule, and if you wanna eat, ya better do what she wants.
16)  LEE
[pickup1][asking for a reminder]Where should we put our weapons before going inside?
17)  ANDY
[pickup1][motioning to where Lee & Larry and leave their weapons] Right there will be fine.
18)  LEE
{normalb}{body-a}[pickup2] Fellas.
19)  ANDY
{sada}{body-a}[pickup2] I'm really sorry about your friend. {normalb}The last thing any of us want is for someone to get hurt out there.
20)  ANDY
{sada}{body-a}[pickup2] How are ya feelin', Lee? I'm really sorry you almost got killed out there. {thinkinga}We should have told you how dangerous it was.
21)  LEE
{normalc}{body-b}[pickup2][irritated]I still don't understand why {angrya}you turned the fence on.
22)  ANDY
{normalb}{body-a}[pickup2] That was just a miscommunication, honest. {sada}I feel real bad about that.
23)  LEE
{normalb}{body-b}[pickup2] What else is there to know about those bandits out there?
24)  LEE
[pickup2]{normalc}Mark's alive. {angryb}Just glad it wasn't worse.
25)  ANDY
[pickup2] {happyb}Don't worry, Mama will take good care of him.
26)  LEE
{angryb}{body-b}[pickup2] Mark's death might have been avoided if {angryc}y'all had just told us what was out there.
27)  ANDY
{thinkinga}{body-a}[pickup2]We didn't mean to hide anything from you, Lee. {sada}Honest.
28)  DANNY
{normalc}{body-a}[pickup2] [shrugging it off]Accidents are gonna happen. {normalb}But we can't let this slide.
29)  DANNY
{alias } {angryA}You saw what they did to your buddy. {normalB}Nobody's safe here until we start to fight back.
30)  LEE
{normalC}How?
31)  DANNY
{normalC}It's cool.  {normalB}You don't have to decide right now.  {normalA}But don't wait too long, or you may not have a choice.
32)  ANDY
{normalb}{body-a}[pickup2] I'll stay here and hold down the fort.
33)  DANNY
{normalC}Remember: we're just doing reconnaissance for now. No use getting ourselves killed.
34)  ANDY
[pickup2] {happyb}Hell, yeah.
35)  DANNY
[pickup2]{normalc}The two of us should go out and do some recon, {happyc}then we'll all mount up for some revenge.
36)  DANNY
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] Changed your mind about goin' out to track down those bandits?
37)  DANNY
{angrya}{body-a} [pickup2]Look, ain't no point in spreading the blame around here.
38)  ANDY
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2]Hey, Lee.
39)  LEE
[pickup2] {angrya}No shit.
40)  ANDY
[pickup2] {normalb}{body-a}Hi.
41)  LEE
{normala}{body-b}[pickup2] Hi...
107)  LEE
{normala}{body-b}[pickup2] Hi...
42)  ANDY
[pickup2] {happyd}{body-handships}I'm glad you guys decided to help us out.
43)  LEE
{normalb}{body-c}[pickup2] I'm gonna get to know the place for a minute.
44)  ANDY
[pickup2] {thinkinga}{body-a}Okay, well, we gotta secure the perimeter {normalb}so don't take too long!
45)  LEE
[pickup2] {happya}{body-b}Mark and I can help you with that perimeter, now.
46)  ANDY
[pickup2] {normalb}I'll turn off the northwest section, {thinkinga}and if you guys could {normalc}strip 'em off and look for any weak points, {happyb}that'd be a big help.
47)  ANDY
[pickup2]{angrya} Stay attentive, ya never know.
48)  LEE
[pickup2] {normala}Okay...
49)  ANDY
[pickup2] Oh, good. The fence stops a walker in about three or four seconds, but gets overloaded if we leave the husks out there.
50)  LEE
[pickup2] {happya}Sounds easy enough.
51)  
It's just the three of you?
52)  
The generators power the dairy?
53)  ANDY
[pickup2] {happyc}{body-a}We got lots. {normalb}And we gotta keep trading for fuel as much as we can. {happya}But they all work together to do the trick. {happyc}Like us.
54)  
The fence stops the walkers?
55)  
Let's go.
56)  
Not now.
57)  LEE
[pickup2] That fence line was a suicide mission.
58)  ANDY
{sada}{body-a}[pickup2] We really are sorry.
59)  
Mark died in vain.
60)  
The fence line was a suicide mission.
61)  
I'd like to go inside.
62)  
Who are the people in the woods?
63)  
Why did you turn the fence on?
64)  ANDY
{thinkinga}{body-a}[pickup2] We don't know. We think some of 'em used to work at the big box up the way.
65)  LEE
{angryc}{body-b}[pickup2] Who the fuck are these people in the woods?
66)  ANDY
[pickup2] {normala}Yeah. Anyway, they're {angrya}nutty as hell. And get mad when they're hungry.
67)  DANNY
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] Save Lots.
68)  LEE
[pickup2]{angryb}My girl's in there.
69)  ANDY
{thinkinga}{body-a}[pickup2] She's with that doctor, right? {happya}Don't worry about her. {normalb}The house is a mess and we'll get ya'll in for {normalc}dinner when mama's ready.
70)  DANNY
{happyc}{body-a}[pickup2] You gotta drain the snake er somethin? {happya}Go 'round to the bushes.
71)  LEE
{angrya}{body-b}[pickup2] I'd like to go inside.
72)  ANDY
{sada}{body-a}[pickup2] I hear ya, but ya know, {thinkinga}she's probably safest in there for now, with {surpriseda}arrows flyin', {normalc}right?
73)  LEE
{angryc}{body-b}[pickup2] I'm not happy about being out here away from my girl.
74)  DANNY
{angrya}{body-a}[pickup2] Well, we better go after them bandits soon. {normalc}Come back when you're ready.
75)  LEE
{angrya}{body-b}[pickup2] I'm gonna go have a look around.
76)  LEE
{normalD}Can we help out with the fence?
77)  ANDY
{normalB}Actually, yeah. {normalA}A couple of walkers managed to get in while the generators were out of gas.
78)  ANDY
{normalC}If y'all can find where they're getting in and fix it, that'd be a big help.
79)  
I'm ready to secure the perimeter.
80)  
You needed help with the fence?
81)  DANNY
[pickup3]So, are ya ready to head out there and find their camp?
82)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]Are you going now?
83)  LEE
[pickup3]Yeah.  I'll be back soon, Clementine.
84)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]Please be lucky.
85)  LEE
[pickup3]I will.
86)  
Are we your first guests?
87)  LEE
[pickup3]We can't be the first people you've invited up to the dairy.
88)  ANDY
[pickup3]Well, no, We've made similar deals with other folks, trading for gas and food, but ultimately they moved on, looking for the people they lost contact with.
89)  LEE
[pickup3]You know, Mark and I can clear the fence ourselves if you want to stay here and finish up with the generators.
90)  ANDY
[pickup3][precceds 310485152]Well, that'd be great!
91)  
Let's go fix the perimeter.
92)  ANDY
[pickup3]I noticed back at the motel that you folks are pretty well armed.  You been stockpiling, huh?
93)  
No one fucks with us.
94)  
We can help protect the dairy.
95)  
How many weapons do YOU have?
96)  LEE
[pickup3]Yeah.  If anyone tries to fuck with us they'll regret it!
97)  ANDY
[pickup3][a bit put off]Well, protecting your people is important, but in my experience, having that many guns around is when people get dangerous.
98)  ANDY
[pickup3]Hopefully it'll never come to that, but thanks.
99)  LEE
[pickup3]Yeah, if you need extra people to protect the dairy, you can count on us!
100)  LEE
[pickup3] We've scraped together a good supply in the last few months. How about yourselves? What kind of protection do you have around here?
101)  ANDY
[pickup3] We've collected a few guns to protect ourselves, but we really only use em' when we go off the property. When we're inside the perimeter, the fence is all we need to keep us safe.
102)  LEE
[pickup3] Yeah.  It'll be a good opportunity to find out a bit more about what we're up against. Let's do it.
103)  LEE
[pickup3] Yeah. We've gotta work together on this. Those bandits are a danger to all. Let's do it.
104)  LEE
[pickup3] I'll do that.
105)  LEE
[pickup3] We'll go in a few minutes, I just need to check on a few things before we head out.
106)  ANDY
[pickup3] Sure, that's understandable. Talk things over with your group, just come find us when you're ready.
