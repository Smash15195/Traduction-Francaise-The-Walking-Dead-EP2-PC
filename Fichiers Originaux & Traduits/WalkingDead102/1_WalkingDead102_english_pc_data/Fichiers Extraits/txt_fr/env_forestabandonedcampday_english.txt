1)  ANDY
[pickup3][ambient]We've got a good system set up for that, but it runs on gas.  You folks are really helping us out.
2)  DANNY
[pickup3]And with the vegetables we grow, we've got plenty of food.
3)  MARK
[pickup3]So, this dairy... you guys really have food?
4)  ANDY
[pickup3]Sure do.  We've lost most of the cattle, but we still have lots of milk, butter and cheese stocked up.
5)  BEN
[pickup3][ambient]And the dead things... they aren't destroying everything?
6)  DOUG
[pickup3]Sure.  I'd like to get a look at that electric fence they talked about.  It might give me some ideas for something I can rig up at the motor inn.
7)  LEE
[pickup3][noticing doug is carrying something]What's that you've got there?
8)  DOUG
[pickup3]Oh.  Nothing.  Just a laser pointer I picked up during our last trip to the drugstore.
9)  LEE
[pickup3][casual]Thanks for coming along, Doug.
10)  CARLEY
[pickup3][casual]It's nice to get away from that motel for a while.  This Lilly/Kenny thing is starting to get ridiculous.
11)  CARLEY
[pickup3]Personally I'd be happier if you started to take charge more.
12)  LEE
[pickup3]Kenny keeps us motivated.  He believes in hope and knows how important it is for us to not give that up.  I can't fault him for that.
13)  LEE
[pickup3]Lilly's way of running things is smart.  It's not easy, but it's keeping us alive.
14)  LEE
[pickup3][doubting himself]You think they'd want me for a leader?
15)  
Kenny keeps us motivated.
16)  
Lilly is a smart leader.
17)  
Me as a leader?
18)  CARLEY
[pickup3] Sure. Everybody looks up to you.
19)  CARLEY
[pickup3]Or maybe you just don't want to be in charge?
20)  CARLEY
[pickup3]Or maybe you just don't want to be in charge?
21)  LEE
[pickup3]Well... not everyone thinks I'm so trustworthy.
22)  LEE
[pickup3]Well... not everyone thinks I'm so trustworthy.
23)  LEE
[pickup3]Well... not everyone thinks I'm so trustworthy.
25)  LEE
[pickup3]Well... not everyone thinks I'm so trustworthy.
24)  CARLEY
[pickup3]You don't agree with me?[that Lee would be a good leader]
26)  CARLEY
[pickup3][earenstly]Because of your past?
27)  CARLEY
[pickup3]What exactly DID happen with the senator?
28)  LEE
[pickup3]...It was an accident.  I mean, I pretty much knew about the affair...
29)  
It was an accident.
30)  CARLEY
[pickup3][slightly hushed, dropping her voice] Does anyone else know?
31)  LEE
[pickup3]["anyone else know about your past?" - Lying in an attempt to keep things simple. ]Just you.
32)  LEE
[pickup3]Larry knows.
33)  CARLEY
[pickup3][understanding how bad it is that Larry knows lee's past]Great, that can't be easy.
34)  LEE
[pickup3] It doesn't matter.
35)  LEE
[pickup3][feeling guilty]Clementine knows.
36)  LEE
[pickup3] She was there when we were talking in the drugstore and asked me about it.
44)  LEE
[pickup3] She was there when we were talking in the drugstore and asked me about it.
37)  
Just you.
38)  
Larry knows.
39)  
It doesn't matter.
40)  LEE
[pickup3]I couldn't lie to her.
41)  CARLEY
[pickup3] Well, I haven't told anyone.
42)  CARLEY
[pickup3]You've got to let go of that guilt. The Lee I know is a good man.
43)  CARLEY
[pickup3]You've got to let go of that guilt. The Lee I know is a good man.
45)  LEE
[pickup3][feeling guilty]Clementine ... might know.
46)  LEE
[pickup3]I lied to her, but... [She's not a stupid girl]
47)  LEE
[pickup3] Now is not the time...
48)  LEE
[pickup3]You know what happened...
49)  
Now is not the time...
50)  
You know what happened...
51)  CARLEY
[pickup3][trying to get lee to open up]Listen, over the years I've reported on some pretty messed up shit.  I've seen situations like yours a hundred times, it doesn't make you a bad man...
52)  CARLEY
[pickup3]Well, I'm here whenever you want to talk...
124)  CARLEY
[pickup3]Well, I'm here whenever you want to talk...
53)  CARLEY
[pickup3]I only know what the press was told.  I don't know your story.
54)  MARK
[pickup3]I mean, thank God Lee showed up when he did!
55)  ANDY
[pickup3] Yeah, why don't you tell us a little more about yourself, Lee?
56)  DANNY
[pickup3]Where are ya from?
57)  LEE
[pickup3]I grew up in Macon.
58)  LEE
[pickup3]The motor inn is my home now I guess.
59)  LEE
[pickup3]I move around a lot.  Hard to call any place home I guess.
60)  ANDY
[pickup3][responding to Lee's silence.] Something tells me you're a local boy. You can always just kinda tell, ya know?
61)  ANDY
[pickup3][friendly]Hm.  That place has seen better days, huh?
62)  DANNY
[pickup3] I used to move around a bit myself, but the dairy will always be home to me.
63)  
I grew up in Macon.
64)  
The motor inn is my home now.
65)  
I move around a lot.
66)  ANDY
[pickup3][admiring]Right in the Heart of Georgia, that's what I like to hear!
67)  ANDY
[pickup3]Y'all seem pretty settled in at that motor inn.  Who's running things over there?
68)  
Lilly.
69)  
Kenny.
70)  
I am.
71)  
It's a democracy.
72)  LEE
[pickup3]Lilly.  She runs a pretty tight ship.  Her and her dad are ex-military.
73)  DOUG
[pickup3]We've actually made it pretty secure.
74)  BEN
[pickup3]I like that alarm system you made.  That's pretty smart.
75)  CARLEY
[pickup3][commenting on the fact that the motel has seen better days]You can say that again.
76)  MARK
[pickup3] Yeah, she knows her shit, but she needs to know when to back off sometimes.
77)  LEE
[pickup3] Kenny's the guy who really keeps the group together.
78)  MARK
[pickup3]Heh, don't let Lilly hear you say that.
79)  LEE
[pickup3]I am.  If you guys have any questions, you come to me.
80)  LEE
[pickup3]We work as a group, all of us looking out for each other.
81)  ANDY
[pickup3]I hear that!  There are so many dumbasses out there fighting  each other these days...  it's just stupid.
82)  DANNY
[pickup3][friendly] How many people ya got over there anyway?
83)  LEE
[pickup3]Nine. Including the kids.
84)  DOUG
[pickup3]Well, ten actually... if you count the new guy.
85)  CARLEY
[pickup3]You forgot Ben.
86)  BEN
[pickup3]Me?
87)  CARLEY
[pickup3]That makes it ten.
88)  LEE
[pickup3]Enough to defend ourselves.
89)  ANDY
[pickup3]Well that's good!  It's getting dangerous out there, well, you guys know.
90)  
Nine. Including the kids.
91)  
Enough to defend ourselves.
92)  
[Change the Subject]
93)  LEE
[pickup3] Well, the kid here is our newest arrival, but we're all looking forward to some food.  We really need it.
94)  ANDY
[pickup3]Well, here's to helping each other out!
96)  ANDY
[pickup3]Well, here's to helping each other out!
95)  MARK
[pickup3][chiming in after Lee remians silent] We've got a lot of hungry folks back there who really appreciate your food offer.
97)  ANDY
[pickup3]Well, we'd love to get ya all out to the dairy.  Like I said, we've got plenty of food, and quite frankly, we could always use an extra helping hand.
98)  BEN
[pickup3]In the summers, I used to help out on a goat farm.
99)  DANNY
[pickup3]  Yeah, that's great. Everything helps!
100)  ANDY
[pickup3]Momma's been running the dairy for as long as I can remember but now it's gettin- [hears a noise and cuts himself off]
101)  BANDIT1
[pickup3][process: in the distance]You think you're gonna cut me out of this?
102)  ANDY
[pickup3][paniced whisper]Shit!  Get down!
103)  DANNY
[pickup3][whispering] Fuckin' bandits.
104)  MARK
[pickup3][whispering] Who?
105)  BEN
[pickup3] [whispering] Those look like the people who raided my camp!
106)  LEE
[pickup3][whispering] Who are they?
107)  ANDY
[pickup3] [whispering]Shh. Fucking assholes is who they are.
108)  DOUG
[pickup3][whispering]What should we do?
109)  CARLEY
[pickup3][whispering]There's only two of them.
110)  DANNY
[pickup3][whispering]Oh no, there's a LOT more of em.
111)  ANDY
[pickup3][whispering]Don't worry.  Danny and I have ya covered if something happens, but let's just wait this out and hope they move on.
112)  BANDIT1
[pickup3][process: in the distance]You and Gary are always pulling this shit!  Don't think we haven't noticed.
113)  BANDIT2
[pickup3][process: in the distance]No one is trying to cut you out of anything!
114)  BANDIT1
[pickup3][process: in the distance]Fuck you, you KNEW we were hungry!  And you guys were keeping it all for yourselves!
115)  BANDIT2
[pickup3][process: in the distance]Calm down, your paranoia is pissing everyone off!
116)  BANDIT2
[pickup3][process: in the distance]Yeah, and you know what, we ate it all!  What are you gonna fucking do about it?
117)  BANDIT1
[pickup3][process: in the distance] FUCK YOU!!
118)  BEN
[pickup3][whispering- seeing a guy shoot another guy in the head][frightened gasp]
119)  DOUG
[pickup3][whispering- seeing a guy shoot another guy in the head]Oh, shit!
120)  CARLEY
[pickup3][whispering- seeing a guy shoot another guy in the head]Jesus!
121)  BANDIT1
[pickup3][process: in the distance - Shooting a guy he's already killed] FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!
122)  BANDIT1
[pickup3][process: in the distance ] Asshole.
123)  ANDY
[pickup3][serious.  Hushed but not whispered]The world out here has gone to shit. Come on, let's get to the dairy where it's safe.
125)  LEE
[pickup3]Not sure everyone would see it that way.
126)  CARLEY
[pickup3]You don't have to. Whatever happened before things went to hell doesn't matter anymore.
127)  CARLEY
[pickup3]Maybe you're right...
128)  LEE
[pickup3]Sometimes I wonder if I should talk to the group about it...
129)  LEE
[pickup3][genuine]I really appreciate that.
130)  MARK
[pickup3] Right Lee?
131)  LEE
[pickup3]Can an electric fence really stop walkers?
132)  LEE
[pickup3]I guess so...
133)  DOUG
[pickup3]The electricity basically cooks you from the inside out, right?
134)  DOUG
[pickup3]So if a walker stays in contact with the fence, it'll eventually cook its brain. Probably takes a while though.
135)  DOUG
[pickup3]As long as the walkers aren't completely dehydrated, and the fence has enough juice, yeah, seems plausble.
136)  DOUG
[pickup3][afterthought]...and that can't be a good smell.  ...Unless it smells like jerky... Man, I could go for some jerky.
137)  DOUG
[pickup3]I shouldn't have turned down that food you offered me earlier.
138)  DOUG
[pickup3][slightly embarased]Heh.  Sorry.
139)  LEE
[pickup3][chuckles slightly]Heh heh... that is one runaway train of thought.
140)  MARK
[pickup3][ambient]People were just grabbing food, guns, water... whatever they could get their hands on.
141)  BEN
[pickup3][ambient]Well.. gas is free now, right?
142)  ANDY
[pickup3][ambient]It is IF you can get it.  I'd rather pull up to a gas station and pay five dollars at the pump than try to fight of some dead guy.
143)  MARK
[pickup3]Man, you shoulda seen how people went crazy back at the air force base.  When the place got overrun, it turned into chaos!
144)  MARK
[pickup3][ambient]Ya know, it seems like just yesterday I was complaining about the price of gas being so high.  I guess that's nothing compared to now.
145)  BEN
[pickup]That's just how it was on the bus.
146)  MARK
[pickup3][ambient]Somehow I ended up getting locked in one of the commissary storage closets.
147)  ANDY
[pickup3][ambient]Or worse, a bunch of hoarders!
