1)  KENNY
[pickup2][Conversation with Lee about leaving the Motel]You told Glenn he was making the wrong call, too.  Maybe he was and maybe he wasn't.  And maybe we'll never know, but at least we gotta be ready.
2)  KENNY
[pickup2][Conversation with Lee about leaving the Motel] "You gotta do what you gotta do." That's what you told Glenn, right?
3)  LEE
[pickup2][Conversation with Kenny about leaving the Motel]Yeah, but he was leaving to find his friends.  Your family's right here.
4)  KENNY
[pickup2][Conversation with Lee about leaving the Motel]You gave Glenn your blessing when he left, I'm just asking you respect my choice as well.
5)  KENNY
[pickup3][Conversation with Lee about leaving the Motel/  blowing the whole conversation off]Well, the RV ain't even working yet so there's no point in talking about it right now.
6)  LEE
[pickup2][Conversation with Kenny about leaving the Motel]Fair enough.

[pickup 2] Here, Kenny, take this.
12)  KENNY
[pickup 2]How about my boy? He eat yet?
13)  LEE
[pickup 2] Here Kenny, take this. We need you at your best.
14)  KENNY
[pickup 2] How about my boy? He eat yet?
15)  KENNY
[pickup 2] Then I truly appreciate you taking care of us, Lee.
16)  LEE
[pickup 2] Yeah, I gave him something.
22)  LEE
[pickup 2] Yeah, I gave him something.
72)  LEE
[pickup 2] Yeah, I gave him something.
17)  LEE
[pickup 2] [a little uneasy]Uh... No.
18)  KENNY
[pickup 2] Come talk to me once my boy's taken care of.
21)  KENNY
[pickup 2] Come talk to me once my boy's taken care of.
19)  KENNY
[pickup 2] Sure, then hand it over, I'm starved. Thanks.
71)  KENNY
[pickup 2] Sure, then hand it over, I'm starved. Thanks.
20)  LEE
[pickup 2] [a little uneasy] No.
23)  LEE
[pickup 2] I didn't have enough for everybody. I thought you could handle yourself.
24)  KENNY
[pickup 2] Hey, you took care of my boy. As far as I'm concerned you did right by me.
25)  KENNY
[pickup 2] You could've at least had the decency to give some food to Duck.  Use your head, Lee.
26)  LEE
[pickup 2]  Lilly has a point about these new people being extra mouths to feed.
27)  LEE
[pickup 2]  [leaving conversation] Let's hope things turn for the better soon.
28)  KENNY
[pickup 2] Now there's a statement I can get behind.
29)  KENNY
[pickup2]I know, but... maybe the problem isn't that there isn't any food, there just isn't any HERE!  We've gotta think about moving on.
30)  KENNY
[pickup2]That ain't no secret, Lee.  It's probably our best bet.
31)  LEE
[pickup2]Word's gettin' out that you wanna leave the motor inn.
32)  LEE
[pikcup2]I'm not sure that's the best idea.
33)  
Lilly's right about these new people...
34)  
Talk To
35)  
Give Food To
36)  LEE
Want something to eat?
75)  LEE
Want something to eat?
37)  
There's not enough food for you...
38)  
Want some food? [Give Food]
39)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - depressed, having givin out 2 piecesof food and running out quickly!]{sadA}Well, that's one more down.  Nine hungry people and only two pieces of food left.
40)  LEE
[pickup3][knowing there is only one more piece of food left]Hm.  Maybe I should keep this for myself?
41)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - depressed, having only 1 piece of food left]One more piece of food to give out, then it's all gone for today.
42)  
[Keep the last piece of food for yourself]
43)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - keeping the last bit of food for himself]I need to keep up my strength, too.
44)  
[Save the last piece of food for someone else]
45)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - choosing to save the food for someone else]Nah.  Some of these people have gone longer than me without food.  They're the ones that need it.
46)  KENNY
[pickup3]Look, you've been good to me and my family.  You saved Duck from those monsters, and ya stood up to Larry at the drugstore.    I won't forget that.  You and Clem are welcome to come with us.
47)  KENNY
[pickup3][Letting Lee down, awkwardly refusing Lee a ride]Listen.  I gotta look out for my family.  I gotta know that whoever I take with me is gonna be looking out for Kat and Duck.
48)  KENNY
[pickup3][cutting Lee off - Arguing, but NOT getting heated, keeping it in a low tone]Once at Hershel's farm and then again with Larry at the drugstore.
49)  LEE
[pickup3][asking Kenny if he'll take Lee and Clem along in the RV once it's fixed] Got room for me and Clem in there?
50)  LEE
[pickup3][attempting to defend his actions when not saving Duck]Wait, I know that-
51)  LEE
[pickup3][attempting to defend his actions when not saving Duck]I didn't-
52)  KENNY
[pickup3][cutting Lee off - Arguing, but NOT getting heated, keeping it in a low tone]Lee, you left Duck in danger twice!
53)  LEE
[pickup3]Oye, Kenny.
54)  KENNY
[pickup3] ¿Qué estás pensando, Lee?
55)  LEE
[pickup3]The guy in the beartrap.  You think we gave up too early?  I think if I had just another minute or two...
56)  KENNY
[pickup3]You saw that guy. His leg was completely mangled.  Even if you got him out what then?  I had my family in mind and you gotta think of Clementine.  We gotta stay alive for them.
57)  LEE
[pickup3]Thanks for buying me time to get that guy out of the bear trap back there.
58)  KENNY
[pickup3]I can't believe you cut off his leg.  I don't know if I coulda done it.
59)  LEE
[pickup3]I didn't have a choice.  It was that or the walkers.
60)  
About the guy in the bear trap...
61)  KENNY
[pickup3]Well, "here" isn't doing us any good.  You should think about coming with us.  You and Clem.
62)  LEE
[pickup3][urging Kenny to stay with the group]We need you here. We have a better chance of surviving as a group.
63)  KENNY
[pickup3]Our BEST chance of surviving is to get away from the mainland!  My mind is made up.
64)  KENNY
[pickup3][confident that leaving is for the best] I know that it is.  I'm taking my family.
65)  LEE
[pickup3]The coast does sound like a smart idea.  Maybe that is the best thing.
66)  LILLY
[pickup3][Seeing Lee give Kenny food]How's it going Lee?  From up here it looks like you're playing favorites.
67)  
[Exit]
68)  
You should stay here.
69)  
The coast does sound like a smart idea.
70)  LEE
Back in a bit.
73)  LEE
Back in a bit.
74)  KENNY
[pickup2] Whatever.
