[pickup 3] {happyA}Have an apple, Carley.
3)  CARLEY
[pickup 2] {happyA}God, I used to eat an apple every morning with some granola and six almonds, and {thinkingA}that wasn't enough then. {happyA}But you know what? Yes.

[pickup 2] [giving some junk food]{normalC}Here.
8)  CARLEY
[pickup 2] [sarcastically] Back in the day, I never would have touched this stuff.  But I'll take whatever I can get, thanks.
9)  LEE
[pickup 2] {fearA}What should we do about the kid?
10)  LEE
[pickup 2] {sadA}Sorry I ran out before I could give you any food.
11)  CARLEY
[pickup 2]{normalB}Hey, don't feel bad. {disgustA}I'd almost rather starve than eat most of that stuff. Besides, {happyA}you've done plenty for me already.
12)  LEE
[pickup2][sean edit] {thinkingA}Sleeping any better?
13)  LEE
[pickup2] [sean edit] {fearA}Drugstore? [as in "still? you still having nightmares about what happened at the drugstore?]
14)  CARLEY
[pickup2][sean edit] {sadA}No. I know we should be grateful for beds, but, no. {sadB}I'm not.
15)  CARLEY
[pickup2][sean edit] {sadB}Yeah.
16)  CARLEY
[pickup2]{thinkingA}If it were up to me, I'd let him stay for a while, see if he proves to be an asset.  {angryA}But that's up to Lilly.  {thinkingA}And with her in charge of the food, I don't want to get on her bad side.
17)  
Sleeping any better?
18)  CARLEY
{disgustA}I want you to have this, okay? In case you or Clementine starts feeling weak.
19)  CARLEY
{thinkingA}You look like crap, Lee. When was the last time you ate?
20)  LEE
[Don't worry about me]{sadA}I'm okay.
21)  LEE
{sadA}You don't owe me anything, Carley.

[pickup3][Thanking Lee for saving him 3 months ago]I know things happened so fast back at the drugstore... And maybe saving me was more of a reaction than a choice, but...
25)  CARLEY
[pickup3][Thanking Lee for saving him 3 months ago]Look, you said you saved me because you thought I needed help.  Well, this is me thinking you and Clementine might need help, too.
26)  CARLEY
[pickup3][Thanking Lee for saving him 3 months ago]I know you said you wanted to save both me and Doug... but you chose me first.  And I - I just...
27)  CARLEY
[pickup3][Thanking Lee for saving him 3 months ago]I know I said it didn't matter why you saved me instead of Doug, but...
28)  CARLEY
[pickup3][sean edit] Me? How about you?
29)  LEE
Want something to eat?
53)  LEE
Want something to eat?
30)  
I'm out of food

Want some food? [Give Food]
32)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - depressed, having givin out 2 piecesof food and running out quickly!]{sadA}Well, that's one more down.  Nine hungry people and only two pieces of food left.
33)  LEE
[pickup3][knowing there is only one more piece of food left]Hm.  Maybe I should keep this for myself?
34)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - depressed, having only 1 piece of food left]One more piece of food to give out, then it's all gone for today.
35)  
[Keep the last piece of food for yourself]
36)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - keeping the last bit of food for himself]I need to keep up my strength, too.
37)  
[Save the last piece of food for someone else]
38)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - choosing to save the food for someone else]Nah.  Some of these people have gone longer than me without food.  They're the ones that need it.
39)  LEE
[pickup3]Lilly has me handing out the food.
40)  CARLEY
[pickup3]Ugh.  That can't be an easy job.
41)  LEE
[pickup3] It's not.  I won't be able to feed everyone.  What should I do?
42)  
What should we do about the kid?
43)  
I'm giving out food, what should I do?
44)  LEE
[pickup3]Thanks Carley.
45)  LEE
[pickup3]What about you?  You need food too.
46)  CARLEY
[pickup3]We ALL need food.  I can't tell you what to do. But whatever happens, I know you'll be trying to do the right thing.
47)  CARLEY
[pickup3]Well, if you wanted to get in good with Lilly, I'd make sure Larry gets some food, even though the guy can be a real dick sometimes.
48)  CARLEY
[pickup3]On the other hand, giving that food to Kenny and his family might make him remember you if he decides to take off in that RV one day.
